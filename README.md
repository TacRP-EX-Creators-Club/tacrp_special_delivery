# Tactical RP - Special Delivery

-------------------------------------------------

## Heads up, operators!  We just got a shipment of weird and exotic weaponry to HQ and command is passing them out to anyone who wants 'em.  These guns may require some unorthodox techniques to handle, so if you don't know what you're doing, uh...  I dunno!  Google the owner's manual or something!

-------------------------------------------------

A small pack of xxx new weapons for TacRP, featuring more delightfully crusty Gamebanana models that some of you might recognize from classic GMod weapon addons.  Built around TacRP's mechanics and using modified TacInt animations (and some wholly original ones), Special Delivery is the perfect addition to any tactical GMod player's arsenal.

[h1]But what's so special about this new pack?[/h1]

When making TacRP InterOps, we limited ourselves to rigging third-party assets onto the vanilla TacInt animations, which proved restrictive at times as we couldn't add certain weapons without significantly editing the animations or creating new ones from scratch.  Special Delivery makes heavy use of animation edits and original animations to bring weapons to TacRP that we couldn't with InterOps, meaning we finally have things like more bullpups and break-action weapons!  We also used this as an opportunity to fill in some holes we left unfilled with InterOps, such as expanding the dual-wielding arsenal.
